# Typst wrapper
[![Tests](https://github.com/zperkinson/typst/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zperkinson/typst/actions/workflows/test.yml)

An extremely simple [Typst](https://typst.app) wrapper.

Currently does not support reading error messages from failed compiles as it was out of scope.
